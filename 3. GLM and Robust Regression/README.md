# Generalized Linear Models and Robust Regression on Python


## Contents:

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Generalized Linear Models:** In this notebook, we will dive deep into mathematics of Generalized Linear Models and see how we can extend the idea of linear regression and logistic regression to derive broad models for predicting targets that have distribution other than normal or binomial. 

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Robust Regression and Outliers** In the second notebook, I talk about how we can use regularization with Logistic Regression. If you are familiar with Linear Regression algorithm that I showed in the previous notebooks. There is not much new stuff in this notebook in terms of regularization. We just add the same terms to Logistic Regression cost function. Then I take our attention to cross validation one more time and introduce another function `StratifiedShuffleSplit()`. Lastly, I introduce another function called `LogisticRegressionCV()` that is used for tuning hyperparameters


**Notes:** The `GridSearchCV()` results makes the notebooks hard to follow. Therefore, I deleted the outputs of GridSearchCV in the notebooks.
