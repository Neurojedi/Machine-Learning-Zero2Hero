# Generalized Linear Models and Robust Regression on Python

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction:

Welcome to the third part of my repository. In these notebooks, we extend our idea of regression to develop some ways to deal with data that have distribution other than normal or binomial and to develop some ways to deal with outliers.

## ðŸ—Š Contents:

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Generalized Linear Models:** In this notebook, we dive deep into the mathematics of Generalized Linear Models and see how we can extend the idea of linear regression and logistic regression to derive broad models for predicting targets that have distribution other than normal or binomial. 

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Robust Regression and Outliers** In this notebook, I introduce some statistical methods such as interquartile range or Z-score to detect outliers. Afterwards, I introduce the linear regression algorithms that are robust against outliers on Python.


**Notes:** The `GridSearchCV()` results makes the notebooks hard to follow. Therefore, I deleted the outputs of GridSearchCV in the notebooks.
