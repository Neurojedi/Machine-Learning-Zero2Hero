# Generalized Linear Models and Robust Regression on Python
In this notebooks, we have two aims 

1. To develop some ways to deal with data that have distribution other than normal or binomial.
2. To develop some ways to deal with outliers.

In the first notebook I introduce some other important parts about the mathematical aspect of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression that I didn't introduce before. On top of that, you will see that we can extent the idea of these two algorithms and generate models to deal with data with different distributions. In the second notebook, we use some other linear regression algorithms that are robust againist outliers. These algoritms are collectively called Robust Regression. We will explore what makes them robust against outliers.

## Contents:

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Generalized Linear Models:** In this notebook, we will dive deep into mathematics of Generalized Linear Models and see how we can extend the idea of linear regression and logistic regression to derive broad models for predicting targets that have distribution other than normal or binomial. 

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Robust Regression and Outliers** In this notebook, I introduce some statistical methods such interquartile range or Z-score to detect outliers. Afterwards, I introduce all the Robust Regression algorithms on Python.


**Notes:** The `GridSearchCV()` results makes the notebooks hard to follow. Therefore, I deleted the outputs of GridSearchCV in the notebooks.
