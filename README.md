Hi,

Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository. In this repository, you will find Jupyter notebooks which combines mathematical aspects and practices of Machine Learning Algorithms. I am planning to publish around 50 notebooks and these notebooks will be educative. 

#### Why am I doing that ? 

Every person has a different way of learning something, the one generally works for me is to teach what I am studying. Even while taking some notes I generally take them as I'm teaching something to someone. As a matter of fact, while learning machine learning and deep learning I also followed a similar way. Afterwards, I thought I could edit and develope my machine learning notebooks, so that other people could make use of it and perhaps expedite their learning process. This notebooks contain a lot of practices and mathematical aspects of algorithms as well as additional sources. 

#### Is it a good idea to combine mathematics and exercises in one notebook ?

* *I am never content until I have constructed a mechanical model of the subject I am studying. If I succeed in making one, I understand. Otherwise, I do not. - Lord Kelvin

Many people would probably seperate the mathematical aspect from the application which may be a good thing to do but I am one of those people who does not get satisfied until he/she constructs a mechanical model of the subject being studied. I like the idea of having the mathematical models in the same notebook so that one can return and revise easily. I hope this is also the way works for you as well.

#### How are notebooks organized ?

For each algorithm that I will introduce, I will follow three main steps.

1. I will firstly explain the algorithms and mathematics under the hood. 
2. Afterwards, I will take you through how to use the algorithm on Python. 
3. Lastly, I will show more practices by using the algorithms on different datasets.

I will try to explain algorithms and code as much as possible, however, these topics may be hard for a beginner. In fact, I did not intend this notebook for beginners but for those who have some idea of how algorithms work and want to improve their understanding of both mathematics behind the algorithms and codes to implement the algorithm. In each section, I added external resources that I found helpful when I was learning machine learning. Furthermore, I did not only introduce the algorithms but also I introduced important preprocessing concepts.  I think notebooks should not only introduce algorithms to someone but also they should provide neccessary information of cross validation, preprocessing and visualization because these steps are really important in machine learning. Moreover, I want these notebooks to be sequential. Every notebook should take one of the ideas further in the previous notebooks. I see this as building a lego star wars jet, In every notebook I introduce in which order you should put lego blocks to build one part of the jet and in the end you will finally build it. Therefore, It is important to understand that the notebooks are sequential. Lastly, I will add also some notebooks that I call Playgrounds which includes some more exercises about the algorithms. 
 
 I think this notebook can help a lot to people who intuitively know the algorithms to some extent but want to dive deeper and get some experience. I hope some people can make use of this notebook and learn these machine learning models.
