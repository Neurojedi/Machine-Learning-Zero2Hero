# Machine-Learning-Zero2Hero

Hi,

Every person has a different way of learning something, the one generally works for me is to teach what I am studying. Even while taking some notes I generally take them as I'm teaching something to someone. As a matter of fact, while learning machine learning and deep learning I also followed a similar way. Afterwards, I thought I could edit and develope my machine learning notebooks, so that other people could make use of it and perhaps expedite their learning process. This notebooks contain a lot of practices and mathematical aspects of algorithms as well as additional sources. Many people should probably seperate the mathematical aspect from the application which may be a good thing to do but I am one of those people who does not get satisfied until he/she constructs a mechanical model of the subject being studied. As Lord Kelvin says "I am never content until I have constructed a mechanical model of the subject I am studying. If I succeed in making one, I understand. Otherwise, I do not." I like the idea of having the mathematical models in the same notebook so that one can return and revise easily. I hope this is also the way works for you as well.

 I will try to explain algorithms and code as much as possible, however, these topics may be hard for a beginner. In fact, I did not intend this notebook for beginners but for those who have some idea of how algorithms work and want to improve their understanding of both mathematics behind the algorithms and codes to implement the algorithm. In each section, I added external resources that I found helpful when I was learning machine learning. Moreover, I reviewed some steps a couple of time in each example, my aim for doing this is to get you more familiar with these steps. I think this notebook can help a lot to people who intuitively know the algorithms to some extent but want to dive deeper and get some experience. I hope some people can make use of this notebook and learn these machine learning models.
