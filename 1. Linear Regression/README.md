# Linear Regression Algorithm on Python
Welcome to first part of my repository. In this part, I will introduce you Linear Regression algorithm as well as basic preprocessing steps, cross validation, hyperparameter tuning and more. 

## Contents:

**1.Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python Regression 1:** In this notebook, I firstly talk about the general concept and mathematics behind linear regression. Afterwards, I show some basic preprocessing steps such as one-hot encoding, cleaning missing values, standardization, transforming target feature into normal distribution. I perform all of these steps on Ames Housing Dataset. Lastly, I train `LinearRegression()` algorithm on this processed dataset.


**2.Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python Regression 2:** Dealing with skewed features, Effect of scaling on performance, data visualizations.

3.Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python Regression 3: Regularzation, Hyperparameters tuning

4.Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python Regression 4: Linear Regression Exercise with Covid Data, animated plots, custom transformers.
