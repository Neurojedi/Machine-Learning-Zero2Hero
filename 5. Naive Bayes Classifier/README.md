# Naive Bayes Classifier on Python

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction 
Welcome to Part 5 of my repository. In this section, we will delve into the Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm, which provides a simple and straightforward way to apply the Bayes Theorem for classification purposes.

## ðŸ—Š Contents:

**Machine Learning on Python - Naive Bayes 1:** In this notebook, I introduce the main concepts and the mathematics behind Naive Bayes algorithm and different Naive Bayes Classifier types that you can use on Python.

**Machine Learning on Python - Naive Bayes 2:** The second notebook builds on the concepts covered in the previous one, providing hands-on practice with two different text classification problems. In the first exercise, we create a spam classifier using the models introduced earlier. Next, we apply these techniques to a more familiar dataset: the IMDB Reviews dataset.


**Notes:** The `GridSearchCV()` and `RandomSearchCV()` results make the notebooks unnecessarily longer. Therefore, I deleted their outputs.
