# Naive Bayes Classifier on Python
Welcome to the fifth part of my repository. In this part, we will talk about an algorithm called Naive Bayes Classifier which is an easy and straightforward application of the Bayes Theorem for classification.

## Contents:

**Machine Learning on Python - Naive Bayes 1:** In this notebook, I introduce the main concept and mathematics behind Naive Bayes algorithm and different Naive Bayes Classifier types that you can use on Python.

**Machine Learning on Python - Naive Bayes 2:** In the second notebook, we practice what we learnt in the previous notebook by using the models on two different text classification problem. In the first practice, we built a spam classifier and then we moved onto a dataset that we are more familiar: IMDB Reviews.


**Notes:** The `GridSearchCV()` and `RandomSearchCV()` results make the notebooks unnecessarily longer. Therefore, I deleted their outputs.
