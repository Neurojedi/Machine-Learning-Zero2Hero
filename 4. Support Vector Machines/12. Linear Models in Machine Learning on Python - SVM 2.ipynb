    "The primal problem can be used when your dataset has a relatively small dimension. In situations in which you have a massive dimension, you need to use something called kernel trick which changes the dimension of your data and tries to get a better separation. In machine learning, the kernel is a function that computes the dot product $\\phi \\left(a\\right)^T\\phi \\left(b\\right)$ based on the original vectors a and b, without really computing the high-order mapping. It computes the dot product as if it mapped the points to high order so it doesn't actually change the dimension. We can calculate $\\phi \\left(x_n\\right)^T\\phi \\left(x_m\\right)$ just like we calculated $x^T_nx_m$ and use this higher dimensional dot product to get a better classifier."

    "\n",
    "Let's talk about commonly used kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Kernel:** This is the standard Kernel Function that we have formulated the SVM Algorithm which is defined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K_{linear}\\left(x,\\:z\\right)=x^Tz$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Polynomial Kernel:** Another kernel we can use is the polynomial kernel.  The polynomial kernel has some parameters that we need to specify. The polynomial kernel is defined as follows. r is called the threshold and d is the power of the kernel. I will use GridSearchCV() to tune them.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K_{poly}\\left(x,\\:z\\right)=\\left(x^Tz+r\\right)^d$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Gaussian Kernel:** This kernel is the most widely used and it is generally default as it outperforms generally the other kernels. It's also called Radial Basis Kernel and it can map the features into infinite dimensional space. The equation below is the general version but generally (actually on both Python and MATLAB) the sigma part is omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K_{rbf}\\left(x,\\:z\\right)=exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma \\:^2}\\left|\\left|x-z\\right|\\right|^2\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sigmoid Kernel:** Lastly we have the sigmoid kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K_{sigmoid}\\left(x,\\:z\\right)=tanh\\left(\\eta xz+r\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we can also define our own kernel but there are some rules that kernels must have to be used properly. These rules are known as Mercer's Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Kernel must be continuous\n",
    "2. Kernel must be symmetric\n",
    "3. Kernel must be positive semi-definite\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay we are done !!!\n",

    "Nu SVC is a very similar implementation of SVC which almost share the same parameters as well. The difference is that instead of the parameter C that we used for regularization, we have another parameter called Nu ($\\nu $) in this classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need that ?** \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with C is that it is not bounded, even though I generally used values between 0 and 1 for tuning it in GridSearch we can actually pass any positive number. On the other hand, Nu is bounded between 0 and 1 which makes it easier for hyperparameter tuning because you can pass a more interpretable range. Nu is defined by the below statement in sklearn:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An upper bound on the fraction of margin errors and a lower bound of the fraction of support vectors. Should be in the interval (0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does that mean ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if we set nu to 0.1 we let %10 of our data can be considered outliers (margin errors) or can be misclassified, in addition, at least %10 of our data will be used as our support vectors. So by using nu we strike a balance between the number of errors allowed and the number of support vectors ( Remember we cannot choose the number of support vectors in classical SVM algorithms that we used previously). I can recommend reading the StackOverflow discussion below for learning more about this parameter. However, I think it's better (if you fancy the mathematics behind it) to read this paper about Nu-SVC [link](http://ntur.lib.ntu.edu.tw/bitstream/246246/155217/1/09.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "[What is the meaning of the nu parameter in Scikit-Learn's SVM class?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/347185/what-is-the-parameter-nu-in-oneclass-svm#:~:text=According%20to%20this%20link%2C%20nu,The%20default%20is%200.1.)"

    "Scaling matters... I did not use any scaling for SVC or LinearSVC but It makes the hyperparameter tuning process take a long time unless I do not use scaling for Nu-SVC. SVM is sensitive to scaling and it may affect drastically the time it takes for training and hyperparameter tuning. It may also improve the results, however, this can be very changeable according to the dataset you have.\n",

    "We previously used SGDRegressor in our regression examples. The classifier version provides us with an implementation of the Linear SVM algorithm and lets us use some parameters that we cannot use with LinearSVM such as elastic net penalty. SGDClassifier actually provides much more classifier algorithms which you can find in the [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html). Let's use Linear SVM with SGDClassifier on handwritten digits."

    "In the robust regression notebook, I said that I would talk about other methods for outlier detection. One of the techniques used for outlier detection (actually for novelty detection) is One-Class SVM. OneClassSVM works in a very similar fashion to SVM. There are two different approaches for One Class SVM, one is proposed by [Schölkopf](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1999/file/8725fb777f25776ffa9076e44fcfd776-Paper.pdf)  and the other one is proposed by [Tax and Duin](http://homepage.tudelft.nl/a9p19/papers/ML_SVDD_04.pdf). `OneClassSVM()` function of Sklearn uses the approach proposed by Schölkopf (I am a huge fan of Schölkopf but I actually like the algorithm proposed by Tax and Duin more not because I think it is a better approach but because It makes more intuitive sense for me). \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm proposed by Schölkopf basically tries to find a hyperplane that separates similar points and dissimilar points in a feature space F and then transforms this feature space back into the input space in which the decision boundary corresponds to a separation between the majority of mass(similar inputs) and the minority of mass(dissimilar inputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "I think we can summarize the algorithm in 5 steps as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The main objective of the algorithm is to return +1 for the region that captures most of the data and -1 elsewhere.\n",
    "2. To do that the algorithm maps the data we have into a feature space and separates the data from the origin.\n",
    "3. Remember that by using the kernel function we are calculating the similarity between two points. Since the inner product of points from the origin will be 0 ($⟨ϕ\\left(x\\right),0⟩=0$) the similarity between the most of data we have and the origin must be low.\n",
    "4. The algorithm maximizes the margin from the origin so that it maximizes the distance between dissimilar points(origin) and similar points.\n",
    "5. And finally, when we map the hyperplane back into the input space we get a decision boundary that separates majority of mass(similar inputs) and the minority of mass(dissimilar inputs)\n",
