# Support Vector Machines Algorithm on Python

## 👋 Introduction 

Welcome to the fourth part of my repository. In this section, we will explore an algorithm called Support Vector Machines (SVM), which is a versatile algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. We'll dive into the details of how SVM works and how it can be applied to real-world problems.

## 🗊 Contents:

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Support Vector Machines 1:** In this notebook, I introduce the main concepts and mathematics behind Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In doing so, I also cover important concepts related to optimization and calculus. Additionally, I demonstrate the use of the `LinearSVC()` method of Sklearn for both binary and multiclass classification tasks. 

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Support Vector Machines 2:** In the second notebook, we learn a very important concept that is used to project data into higher dimensional spaces called Kernel Method. Moreover, I introduce the two mainly used SVC implementations on Python which are `SVC()` and `NuSVC()`. Lastly, I also briefly talk about `SGDClassifier()` and `OneClassSVM()`.

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Support Vector Machines 3:** The third notebook focuses on applying the algorithms we learnt in the previous Support Vector Machines (SVM) notebooks. We will perform a binary classification task using the Australian Rain dataset, as well as a multiclass classification task using the Wine Quality dataset.

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Logistic Regression 4:** In the last notebook, we see how we can use the SVM algorithm for regression. In addition, I also introduce some other regression algorithms that I didn't talk about previously such as Bayesian Regression and Least Angle Regression.


**Notes:** The `GridSearchCV()` results makes the notebooks hard to follow. Therefore, I deleted the outputs of GridSearchCV in the notebooks.
