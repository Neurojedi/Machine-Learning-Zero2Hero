# Support Vector Machines Algorithm on Python
Welcome to fourth part of my repository. In this part, we will talk about an algorithm called Support Vector Machines which can be used for both Regression and Classification.

## Contents:

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Support Vector Machines 1:** In this notebook, I introduce the main concept and mathematics behind Support Vector Machines, by extenion of this, I also introduce some important concepts about optimization and calculus. Moreover, I use `LinearSVC()` class for binary and multiclass classification.



**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Support Vector Machines 2:** In the second notebook, we learn a very important concept that is used to project data into higher dimensional spaces. Moreover, I introduce the two mainly used SVC implementation on Python which are `SVC()` and `NuSVC()`. Lastly, I also briefly talk about `SGDClassifier()` and `OneClassSVM()`.

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Support Vector Machines 3:** In the third notebook, we practice the algorithms we learnt in the previous SVM notebooks by performing one binary classification problem using Australian Rain dataset  and one multiclass classification problem using Wine Quality dataset.

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Logistic Regression 4:** In the last notebook, we see how we can use SVM algorithm for regression.


**Notes:** The `GridSearchCV()` results makes the notebooks hard to follow. Therefore, I deleted the outputs of GridSearchCV in the notebooks.
