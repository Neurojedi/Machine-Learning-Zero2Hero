# Logistic Regression Algorithm on Python
Welcome to second part of my repository. In this part, I will introduce you the basics of classification as well as the most basic model that we can use for classification. 

## Contents:

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Logistic Regression 1:** In the first notebook, I firstly introduce the mathematical concepts behind Logistic Regression and show how the algorithm is used on Python. Afterwards, We revisit an important concept cross validation and explore some other important functions of cross validation. In addition, there are some other important metrics that are widely used for evaluation classification performance and in the second part of this notebook I introduce these metrics and some plots related to them..


**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Logistic Regression 2:** In the second notebook, I talk about how we can use regularization with Logistic Regression. If you are familiar with Linear Regression algorithm that I showed in the previous notebooks. There is not much new stuff in this notebook in terms of regularization. We just add the same terms to Logistic Regression cost function. Then I take our attention to cross validation one more time and introduce another function `StratifiedShuffleSplit()`. Lastly, I introduce another function called `LogisticRegressionCV()` that is used for tuning hyperparameters

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Logistic Regression 3:** . In the third notebook, we see how we can extend the idea of logistic regression and perform the algorithm on multiclass classification problems by using some strategies. Moreover, we see how we can use the plots that we used earlier in multiclass classification.

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Logistic Regression 4:** In the last notebook, we practice what we learnt in the first three notebooks and also talk about some ways to deal with class imbalance.


**Notes:** The `GridSearchCV()` results makes the notebooks hard to follow. Therefore, I deleted the outputs of GridSearchCV in the notebooks.
