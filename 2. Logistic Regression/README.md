# Logistic Regression Algorithm on Python

## 👋 Introduction:

Welcome to second part of my repository. In this part, I introduce you the basics of classification as well as the most basic model that we can use for classification. 

## 🗊 Contents:

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Logistic Regression 1:** This notebook provides an introduction to logistic regression and its implementation in Python. We first cover the mathematical concepts behind logistic regression and then demonstrate how to use the algorithm in Python. Additionally, we revisit the concept of cross-validation and explore some other important functions related to it. We also introduce important metrics used for evaluating classification performance in the second part of this notebook.

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Logistic Regression 2:** In this notebook, we discuss regularization in logistic regression. We demonstrate how to add regularization terms to the cost function and introduce the `StratifiedShuffleSplit()` function for cross-validation. We also discuss hyperparameter tuning with the `LogisticRegressionCV()` function.

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Logistic Regression 3:** In this notebook, we extend logistic regression to multiclass classification problems using different strategies. We also explore how to use the same plots introduced earlier for the evaluation of multiclass classification.

**Linear Models in Machine Learning on Python - Logistic Regression 4:** In the final notebook of this series, we put into practice what we learnt in the previous three notebooks. Additionally, we discuss ways to address class imbalance in logistic regression.

**Notes:** The `GridSearchCV()` results makes the notebooks hard to follow. Therefore, I deleted the outputs of GridSearchCV in the notebooks.
